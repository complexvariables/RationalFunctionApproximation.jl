  abstract = {In this paper, we address the problem of approximating a multivariate function defined on a general domain in \$d\$ dimensions from sample points.  We consider weighted least-squares approximation in an arbitrary finite-dimensional space \$P\$ from independent random samples taken according to a suitable measure. In general, least-squares approximations can be inaccurate and ill-conditioned when the number of sample points \$M\$ is close to \$N = \textbackslash dim(P)\$. To counteract this, we introduce a novel method for sampling in general domains which leads to provably accurate and well-conditioned approximations.  The resulting sampling measure is discrete and therefore straightforward to sample from.  Our main result shows near-optimal sample complexity for this procedure; specifically, \$M = \textbackslash mathcal\{O\}(N \textbackslash log(N))\$ samples suffice for a well-conditioned and accurate approximation.  Numerical experiments on polynomial approximation in general domains confirm the benefits of this method over standard sampling.},

  abstract = {In recent years, the use of sparse recovery techniques in the approximation of high-dimensional functions has garnered increasing interest. In this work we present a survey of recent progress in this emerging topic. Our main focus is on the computation of polynomial approximations of high-dimensional functions on \$d\$-dimensional hypercubes. We show that smooth, multivariate functions possess expansions in orthogonal polynomial bases that are not only approximately sparse, but possess a particular type of structured sparsity defined by so-called lower sets. This structure can be exploited via the use of weighted \$\textbackslash ell\textasciicircum 1\$ minimization techniques, and, as we demonstrate, doing so leads to sample complexity estimates that are at most logarithmically dependent on the dimension \$d\$. Hence the curse of dimensionality - the bane of high-dimensional approximation - is mitigated to a significant extent. We also discuss several practical issues, including unknown noise (due to truncation or numerical error), and highlight a number of open problems and challenges.},

  abstract = {This paper concerns the approximation of smooth, high-dimensional functions from limited samples using polynomials. This task lies at the heart of many applications in computational science and engineering -- notably, those arising from parametric modelling and uncertainty quantification. It is common to use Monte Carlo (MC) sampling in such applications, so as not to succumb to the curse of dimensionality. However, it is well known this strategy is theoretically suboptimal. There are many polynomial spaces of dimension \$n\$ for which the sample complexity scales log-quadratically in \$n\$. This well-documented phenomenon has led to a concerted effort to design improved, in fact, near-optimal strategies, whose sample complexities scale log-linearly, or even linearly in \$n\$. Paradoxically, in this work we show that MC is actually a perfectly good strategy in high dimensions. We first document this phenomenon via several numerical examples. Next, we present a theoretical analysis that resolves this paradox for holomorphic functions of infinitely-many variables. We show that there is a least-squares scheme based on \$m\$ MC samples whose error decays algebraically fast in \$m/\textbackslash log(m)\$, with a rate that is the same as that of the best \$n\$-term polynomial approximation. This result is non-constructive, since it assumes knowledge of a suitable polynomial space in which to perform the approximation. We next present a compressed sensing-based scheme that achieves the same rate, except for a larger polylogarithmic factor. This scheme is practical, and numerically it performs as well as or better than well-known adaptive least-squares schemes. Overall, our findings demonstrate that MC sampling is eminently suitable for smooth function approximation when the dimension is sufficiently high. Hence the benefits of improved sampling strategies are generically limited to lower-dimensional settings.},

This method is based on variable transforms using particular parametrized exponential and double-exponential mappings, in combination with Fourier-like approximation in a truncated domain.  We show theoretically that this method is superior to variable transform techniques based on the standard exponential and double-exponential mappings.  In particular, it can resolve oscillatory behavior using near-optimal degrees of freedom, whereas the standard mappings require degrees of freedom that grow superlinearly with the frequency of oscillation.  We highlight these results with several numerical experiments.  Therein it is observed that near-machine epsilon accuracy is achieved using a number of degrees of freedom that is 4--10 times smaller than those of existing techniques.},

This allows a user to work with functions instead of vectors and with integral operators instead of matrices. The solution process therefore is much closer to the analysis of ill-posed problems than standard linear algebra-based solution methods. Furthermore, the difficult process of explicitly choosing a suitable discretization is not required.},

Several of these are new, and some correspond to discrete moving mesh equations that have been used by others. Their stability is analyzed and it is seen that a key term for most of these moving mesh PDEs is a source-like term that measures the level of equidistribution. It is shown that under weak assumptions mesh crossing cannot occur for most of them. Finally, numerical experiments for these various moving mesh PDEs are performed to study their relative properties.},

It can be viewed as a higher-dimensional generalization of the moving mesh PDE (MMPDE) strategy developed in our previous work for one-dimensional problems [W. Huang, Y. Ren, and R. D. Russell, SIAM J. Numer. Anal., 31 (1994), pp. 709--730]. The MMPDE is derived from a gradient flow equation which arises using a mesh adaptation functional in turn motivated from the theory of harmonic maps. Geometrical interpretations are given for the gradient equation and functional, and basic properties of this MMPDE are discussed. Numerical examples are presented where the method is used both for mesh generation and for solving time-dependent PDEs. The results demonstrate the potential of the mesh movement strategy to concentrate the mesh points so as to adapt to special problem features and to also preserve a suitable level of mesh orthogonality.},

The case of a cross-shaped region is introduced and developed. These methods are used to circumvent the severe ill-conditioning due to the crowding phenomenon suffered by conformal maps from the unit disk to target regions with elongated sections while preserving the fast Fourier methods available on the disk. The methods are based on expanding the mapping function in the Faber series for the regions. All of these methods proceed by approximating the boundary correspondence of the map with a Newton-like iteration. At each Newton step, a system of linear equations is solved using the conjugate gradient method. The matrix-vector multiplication in this inner iteration can be implemented with fast Fourier transforms at a cost of O(N log N). It is shown that the linear systems are discretizations of the identity plus a compact operator and so the conjugate gradient method converges superlinearly. Several computational examples are given along with a discussion of the accuracy of the methods.},

  abstract = {Traveling waves in woodpile chains are typically nanoptera, which are composed of a central solitary wave and exponentially small oscillations. These oscillations have been studied using exponential asymptotic methods, which typically require an explicit form for the leading-order behavior. For many nonlinear systems, such as granular woodpile chains, it is not possible to calculate the leading-order solution explicitly. We show that accurate asymptotic approximations can be obtained using numerical approximation in place of the exact leading-order behavior. We calculate the oscillation behavior for Toda woodpile chains, and compare the results to exponential asymptotics based on previous methods from the literature: long-wave approximation and tanh-fitting. We then use numerical analytic continuation methods based on Padé approximants and the adaptive Antoulas–Anderson (AAA) method. These methods are shown to produce accurate predictions of the amplitude of the oscillations and the mass ratios for which the oscillations vanish. Exponential asymptotics using an AAA approximation for the leading-order behavior is then applied to study granular woodpile chains, including chains with Hertzian interactions—this method is able to calculate behavior that could not be accurately approximated in previous studies.},

We show that ESPIRA can be interpreted as a matrix pencil method (MPM) applied to Loewner matrices. These Loewner matrices are closely connected with the Hankel matrices that are usually employed for signal recovery. Due to the construction of the Loewner matrices via an adaptive selection of index sets, the MPM is stabilized. ESPIRA achieves similar recovery results for exact data as ESPRIT and the MPM, but with less computational effort. Moreover, ESPIRA strongly outperforms ESPRIT and the MPM for noisy data and for signal approximation by short exponential sums.},

Here we introduce a continuum AAA algorithm that discretizes a domain adaptively as it goes. This enables fast computation of high-accuracy rational approximations on domains such as the unit interval, the unit circle, and the imaginary axis, even in some cases where resolution of singularities requires exponentially clustered sample points, support points, and poles. Prototype MATLAB (or Octave) and Julia codes aaax, aaaz, and aaai are provided for these three special domains; the latter two are equivalent by a Moebius transformation. Execution is very fast since the matrices whose SVDs are computed have only three times as many rows as columns. The codes include a AAA-Lawson option for improvement of a AAA approximant to minimax, so long as the accuracy is well above machine precision. The result returned is pole-free in the approximation domain.},

A perceived practical obstacle is that the interpolation matrix becomes increasingly ill-conditioned as the RBF shape parameter becomes small, corresponding to flat RBFs. Two stable approaches that overcome this problem exist: the Contour-Padé method and the RBF-QR method. However, the former is limited to small node sets, and the latter has until now been formulated only for the surface of the sphere. This paper focuses on an RBF-QR formulation for node sets in one, two, and three dimensions. The algorithm is stable for arbitrarily small shape parameters. It can be used for thousands of node points in two dimensions and still more in three dimensions. A sample MATLAB code for the two-dimensional case is provided.},

To justify this claim, first we prove a theorem establishing root-exponential convergence of rational approximations near corners in a conformal map, generalizing a result of D. J. Newman in 1964. This leads to the new algorithm for approximating conformal maps of polygons. Then we turn to smooth domains and prove a sequence of four theorems establishing that in any conformal map of the unit circle onto a region with a long and slender part, there must be a singularity or loss of univalence exponentially close to the boundary, and polynomial approximations cannot be accurate unless of exponentially high degree. This motivates the application of the new algorithm to smooth domains, where it is again found to be highly effective.},

  abstract = {We solve viscous Burgersʼ equation using a fast and accurate algorithm—referred to here as the reduction algorithm—for computing near optimal rational approximations. Given a proper rational function with n poles, the reduction algorithm computes (for a desired L∞-approximation error) a rational approximation of the same form, but with a (near) optimally small number m≪n of poles. Although it is well known that (nonlinear) optimal rational approximations are much more efficient than linear representations of functions via a fixed basis (e.g. wavelets), their use in numerical computations has been limited by a lack of efficient, robust, and accurate algorithms. The reduction algorithm presented here computes reliably (near) optimal rational approximations with high accuracy (e.g., ≈10−14) and a complexity that is essentially linear in the number n of original poles. A key tool is a recently developed algorithm for computing small con-eigenvalues of Cauchy matrices with high relative accuracy, an impossible task for standard algorithms without extended precision. Using the reduction algorithm, we develop a numerical calculus for rational representations of functions. Indeed, while operations such as multiplication and convolution increase the number of poles in the representation, we use the reduction algorithm to maintain an optimally small number of poles. To demonstrate the efficiency, robustness, and accuracy of our approach, we solve Burgersʼ equation with small viscosity ν. It is well known that its solutions exhibit moving transition regions of width O(ν), so that this equation provides a stringent test for adaptive PDE solvers. We show that optimal rational approximations capture the solutions with high accuracy using a small number of poles. In particular, we solve the equation with local accuracy ϵ=10−9 for viscosity as small as ν=10−5.},

The quadrature is obtained from a bilinear form of eigenvectors of the matrix associated to the recurrence equation of the Hermite polynomials. These eigenvectors are discrete approximations of the Hermite functions, which are eigenfunctions of the fractional Fourier transform operator. This new discrete transform is unitary and has a group structure. By using some asymptotic formulas, we rewrite the quadrature in terms of the fast Fourier transform (FFT), yielding a fast discretization of the fractional Fourier transform and its inverse in closed form. We extend the range of the fractional Fourier transform by considering arbitrary complex values inside the unit circle and not only at the boundary. We find that this fast quadrature evaluated at \$z=i\$ becomes a more accurate version of the FFT and can be used for nonperiodic functions.},

  abstract = {We present a novel algorithm for computing best uniform rational approximations to real scalar functions in the setting of zero defect. The method, dubbed BRASIL (best rational approximation by successive interval length adjustment), is based on the observation that the best rational approximation r to a function f must interpolate f at a certain number of interpolation nodes (xj). Furthermore, the sequence of local maximum errors per interval (xj−\,1,xj) must equioscillate. The proposed algorithm iteratively rescales the lengths of the intervals with the goal of equilibrating the local errors. The required rational interpolants are computed in a stable way using the barycentric rational formula. The BRASIL algorithm may be viewed as a fixed-point iteration for the interpolation nodes and converges linearly. We demonstrate that a suitably designed rescaled and restarted Anderson acceleration (RAA) method significantly improves its convergence rate. The new algorithm exhibits excellent numerical stability and computes best rational approximations of high degree to many functions in a few seconds, using only standard IEEE double-precision arithmetic. A free and open-source implementation in Python is provided. We validate the algorithm by comparing to results from the literature. We also demonstrate that it converges quickly in some situations where the current state-of-the-art method, the minimax function from the Chebfun package which implements a barycentric variant of the Remez algorithm, fails.},

We make careful use of numerical experiments, which are summarized in a sequence of nine figures.

The various boundary conditions deliver extensive flexibility in the near-wall statistics that can be modelled. Reproduction of both fully developed shear-free and uniform shear boundary layer turbulence are highlighted as two simple physical applications; the first of which is also directly validated with experimental data. The rendering of inhomogeneous synthetic turbulence inlet boundary conditions is an additional application, motivated by contemporary numerical wind tunnel simulations.

The rational approximation is embedded in the state-space representation of a rational polynomial by Su and Bai. This procedure perfectly fits the framework of the compact rational Krylov methods (CORK and TS-CORK), allowing solve large-scale NEPs to be efficiently solved. One advantage of our method, compared to related techniques such as NLEIGS and infinite Arnoldi, is that it automatically selects the poles and zeros of the rational approximations. Numerical examples show that the presented framework is competitive with NLEIGS and usually produces smaller linearizations with the same accuracy but with less effort for the user.},

  abstract = {A new algorithm is presented which provides a fast method for the computation of recently developed Fourier continuations (a particular type of Fourier extension method) that yield superalgebraically convergent Fourier series approximations of nonperiodic functions. Previously, the coefficients of an approximating Fourier series have been obtained by means of a regularized singular value decomposition (SVD)-based least-squares solution to an overdetermined linear system of equations. These SVD methods are effective when the size of the system does not become too large, but they quickly become unwieldy as the number of unknowns in the system grows. We demonstrate a novel decoupling of the least-squares problem which results in two systems of equations, one of which may be solved quickly by means of fast Fourier transforms (FFTs) and another that is demonstrated to be well approximated by a low-rank system. Utilizing randomized algorithms, the low-rank system is reduced to a significantly smaller system of equations. This new system is then efficiently solved with drastically reduced computational cost and memory requirements while still benefiting from the advantages of using a regularized SVD. The computational cost of the new algorithm in on the order of the cost of a single FFT multiplied by a slowly increasing factor that grows only logarithmically with the size of the system.},

  abstract = {Numerical simulation of large-scale dynamical systems plays a fundamental role in studying a wide range of complex physical phenomena; however, the inherent large-scale nature of the models often leads to unmanageable demands on computational resources. Model reduction aims to reduce this computational burden by generating reduced models that are faster and cheaper to simulate, yet accurately represent the original large-scale system behavior. Model reduction of linear, nonparametric dynamical systems has reached a considerable level of maturity, as reflected by several survey papers and books. However, parametric model reduction has emerged only more recently as an important and vibrant research area, with several recent advances making a survey paper timely. Thus, this paper aims to provide a resource that draws together recent contributions in different communities to survey the state of the art in parametric model reduction methods. Parametric model reduction targets the broad class of problems for which the equations governing the system behavior depend on a set of parameters. Examples include parameterized partial differential equations and large-scale systems of parameterized ordinary differential equations. The goal of parametric model reduction is to generate low-cost but accurate models that characterize system response for different values of the parameters. This paper surveys state-of-the-art methods in projection-based parametric model reduction, describing the different approaches within each class of methods for handling parametric variation and  providing a comparative discussion that lends insights to potential advantages and disadvantages in applying each of the methods. We highlight the important role played by parametric model reduction in design, control, optimization, and uncertainty quantification---settings that require repeated model evaluations over different parameter values.},

Eigenpairs of the expanded form of this linearization are not extracted directly. Instead, its structure is exploited to develop a scheme that allows to extract all eigenvalues in a certain region of the complex plane by solving an eigenvalue problem of much smaller dimension. Because of its simple implementation and the ability to work efficiently in large dimensions, the presented method is appealing when solving challenging engineering problems. A few theoretical results are established to explain why the new approach works and numerical experiments are presented to validate the proposed algorithm.},

The first type of two-phase interface problem is the fluid-fluid (two-phase flow) interface problem modeled by Navier–Stokes equations with high-contrast physical parameters across the interface. The second one is the fluid-structure interaction problem modeled by Navier–Stokes equations on one side of the interface and the structural equation on the other side, where the fluid and the structure interact with each other via the kinematic and dynamic interface conditions across the interface. Following the PINNs framework, the DNN/meshfree method is respectively developed for two kinds of two-phase interface problems by approximating the solutions using different DNN’s structures in different subdomains and reformulating the interface problems as least-squares minimization problems based on a space-time sampling-point set (as the training dataset). Mathematically, the approximation error analyses are carried out for both interface problems, revealing an intrinsic strategy for efficiently sampling points to improve the accuracy. In addition, compared with traditional discretization approaches (e.g., finite element/volume/difference methods), the proposed DNN/meshfree method and its error analysis technique can be smoothly extended to many other dynamic interface problems with stationary interfaces. Numerical experiments illustrate the accuracy of the proposed method for the presented two-phase interface problems and validate theoretical results to some extent through two numerical examples.},

It is observed that these algorithms are both special cases of a single filter bank structure, the discrete wavelet transform, the behavior of which is governed by the choice of filters. In fact, the a trous algorithm is more properly viewed as a nonorthonormal multiresolution algorithm for which the discrete wavelet transform is exact. Moreover, it is shown that the commonly used Lagrange a trous filters are in one-to-one correspondence with the convolutional squares of the Daubechies filters for orthonormal wavelets of compact support. A systematic framework for the discrete wavelet transform is provided, and conditions are derived under which it computes the continuous wavelet transform exactly. Suitable filter constraints for finite energy and boundedness of the discrete transform are also derived. Relevant signal processing parameters are examined, and it is observed that orthonormality is balanced by restrictions on resolution.{$<>$}},

Our generalizations of triangularity and pivoting are based on a new notion of a ‘triangular quasimatrix’.

Extensive and wide-ranging numerical experiments are involved. We then present further experiments giving evidence that in all of these applications, it is advantageous to use exponential clustering whose density on a logarithmic scale is not uniform but tapers off linearly to zero near the singularity. We propose a theoretical model of the tapering effect based on the Hermite contour integral and potential theory, which suggests that tapering doubles the rate of convergence. Finally we show that related mathematics applies to the relationship between exponential (not tapered) and doubly exponential (tapered) quadrature formulas.

It is observed that in typical problems the “error curve,” the image of the unit circle under (f − p∗)(z), often approximates to a startling degree a perfect circle with winding number n + 1. This phenomenon is approached by consideration of related problems whose error curves are exactly circular, making use of a classical theorem of Carathéodory and Fejér. This leads to a technique for calculating approximations in one step that are roughly as close to best as the best approximation error curve is close to circular, and hence to strong theorems on near-circularity as the radius of the domain shrinks to 0 or as n increases to ∞. As a computational example, very tight bounds are given for approximation of ez on the unit disk. The generality of the near-circularity phenomenon (more general domains, rational approximation) is discussed.},
