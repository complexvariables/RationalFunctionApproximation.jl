  abstract = {Abstract. The AAA algorithm has become a popular tool for data-driven rational approximation of single-variable functions, such as transfer functions of a linear dynamical system. In the setting of parametric dynamical systems appearing in many prominent applications, the underlying (transfer) function to be modeled is a multivariate function. With this in mind, we develop the AAA framework for approximating multivariate functions where the approximant is constructed in the multivariate barycentric form. The method is data driven, in the sense that it does not require access to the full state-space model and requires only function evaluations. We discuss an extension to the case of matrix-valued functions, i.e., multi-input/multi-output dynamical systems, and provide a connection to the tangential interpolation theory. Several numerical examples illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.}

Brubeck and Trefethen [SIAM J. Sci. Comput., 44 (2022), pp. A1205--A1226] recently introduced a lightning Stokes solver that uses rational functions to approximate the Goursat functions in polygonal domains. In this paper, we present the LARS algorithm (lightning-AAA rational Stokes) for computing two-dimensional (2D) Stokes flows in domains with smooth boundaries and multiply connected domains using lightning and AAA rational approximation [Y. Nakatsukasa, O. S{\`e}te, and L. N. Trefethen, SIAM J. Sci. Comput., 40 (2018), pp. A1494--A1522]. After validating our solver against known analytical solutions, we solve a variety of 2D Stokes flow problems with physical and engineering applications. Using these examples, we show rational approximation can now be used to compute 2D Stokes flows in general domains. The computations take less than a second and give solutions with at least 6-digit accuracy.}

We propose that it is much simpler, and 10--1000 times faster, to represent the maps by rational functions computed by the AAA algorithm. To justify this claim, first we prove a theorem establishing root-exponential convergence of rational approximations near corners in a conformal map, generalizing a result of D. J. Newman in 1964. This leads to the new algorithm for approximating conformal maps of polygons. Then we turn to smooth domains and prove a sequence of four theorems establishing that in any conformal map of the unit circle onto a region with a long and slender part, there must be a singularity or loss of univalence exponentially close to the boundary, and polynomial approximations cannot be accurate unless of exponentially high degree. This motivates the application of the new algorithm to smooth domains, where it is again found to be highly effective.},

Given a proper rational function with n poles, the reduction algorithm computes (for a desired L{$\infty$}-approximation error) a rational approximation of the same form, but with a (near) optimally small number m{$\ll$}n of poles. Although it is well known that (nonlinear) optimal rational approximations are much more efficient than linear representations of functions via a fixed basis (e.g. wavelets), their use in numerical computations has been limited by a lack of efficient, robust, and accurate algorithms. The reduction algorithm presented here computes reliably (near) optimal rational approximations with high accuracy (e.g., {$\approx$}10-14) and a complexity that is essentially linear in the number n of original poles. A key tool is a recently developed algorithm for computing small con-eigenvalues of Cauchy matrices with high relative accuracy, an impossible task for standard algorithms without extended precision. Using the reduction algorithm, we develop a numerical calculus for rational representations of functions. Indeed, while operations such as multiplication and convolution increase the number of poles in the representation, we use the reduction algorithm to maintain an optimally small number of poles. To demonstrate the efficiency, robustness, and accuracy of our approach, we solve Burgers' equation with small viscosity {$\nu$}. It is well known that its solutions exhibit moving transition regions of width O({$\nu$}), so that this equation provides a stringent test for adaptive PDE solvers. We show that optimal rational approximations capture the solutions with high accuracy using a small number of poles. In particular, we solve the equation with local accuracy {$\epsilon$}=10-9 for viscosity as small as {$\nu$}=10-5.},

A set-valued variant of the AAA algorithm is also presented for building low-degree rational approximations of NEPs with a large number of nonlinear functions. The rational approximation is embedded in the state-space representation of a rational polynomial by Su and Bai. This procedure perfectly fits the framework of the compact rational Krylov methods (CORK and TS-CORK), allowing solve large-scale NEPs to be efficiently solved. One advantage of our method, compared to related techniques such as NLEIGS and infinite Arnoldi, is that it automatically selects the poles and zeros of the rational approximations. Numerical examples show that the presented framework is competitive with NLEIGS and usually produces smaller linearizations with the same accuracy but with less effort for the user.}

  abstract = {Numerical simulation of large-scale dynamical systems plays a fundamental role in studying a wide range of complex physical phenomena; however, the inherent large-scale nature of the models often leads to unmanageable demands on computational resources. Model reduction aims to reduce this computational burden by generating reduced models that are faster and cheaper to simulate, yet accurately represent the original large-scale system behavior. Model reduction of linear, nonparametric dynamical systems has reached a considerable level of maturity, as reflected by several survey papers and books. However, parametric model reduction has emerged only more recently as an important and vibrant research area, with several recent advances making a survey paper timely. Thus, this paper aims to provide a resource that draws together recent contributions in different communities to survey the state of the art in parametric model reduction methods. Parametric model reduction targets the broad class of problems for which the equations governing the system behavior depend on a set of parameters. Examples include parameterized partial differential equations and large-scale systems of parameterized ordinary differential equations. The goal of parametric model reduction is to generate low-cost but accurate models that characterize system response for different values of the parameters. This paper surveys state-of-the-art methods in projection-based parametric model reduction, describing the different approaches within each class of methods for handling parametric variation and  providing a comparative discussion that lends insights to potential advantages and disadvantages in applying each of the methods. We highlight the important role played by parametric model reduction in design, control, optimization, and uncertainty quantification---settings that require repeated model evaluations over different parameter values.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a method for computing eigenvalues and eigenvectors for some types of nonlinear eigenvalue problems. The main idea is to approximate the functions involved in the eigenvalue problem by rational functions and then apply a form of linearization. Eigenpairs of the expanded form of this linearization are not extracted directly. Instead, its structure is exploited to develop a scheme that allows to extract all eigenvalues in a certain region of the complex plane by solving an eigenvalue problem of much smaller dimension. Because of its simple implementation and the ability to work efficiently in large dimensions, the presented method is appealing when solving challenging engineering problems. A few theoretical results are established to explain why the new approach works and numerical experiments are presented to validate the proposed algorithm.},

  abstract = {Rational approximations of functions with singularities can converge at a root-exponential rate if the poles are exponentially clustered. We begin by reviewing this effect in minimax, least-squares, and AAA approximations on intervals and complex domains, conformal mapping, and the numerical solution of Laplace, Helmholtz, and biharmonic equations by the ``lightning'' method. Extensive and wide-ranging numerical experiments are involved. We then present further experiments giving evidence that in all of these applications, it is advantageous to use exponential clustering whose density on a logarithmic scale is not uniform but tapers off linearly to zero near the singularity. We propose a theoretical model of the tapering effect based on the Hermite contour integral and potential theory, which suggests that tapering doubles the rate of convergence. Finally we show that related mathematics applies to the relationship between exponential (not tapered) and doubly exponential (tapered) quadrature formulas. Here it is the Gauss--Takahasi--Mori contour integral that comes into play.},

Even on a disk or interval the algorithm may outperform existing methods, and on more complicated domains it is especially competitive.  The core ideas are (1) representation of the rational approximant in barycentric form with interpolation at certain support points and (2) greedy selection of the support points to avoid exponential instabilities.  The name AAA stands for ``adaptive Antoulas--Anderson'' in honor of the authors who introduced a scheme based on (1).  We present the core algorithm with a MATLAB code and nine applications and describe variants targeted at problems of different kinds. Comparisons are made with vector fitting, RKFIT, and other existing methods for rational approximation.}
