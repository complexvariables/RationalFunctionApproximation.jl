  abstract = {We consider a class of mathematical models describing multiphysics phenomena interacting through interfaces. On such interfaces, the traces of the fields lie (approximately) in the range of a weighted sum of two fractional differential operators. We use a rational function approximation to precondition such operators. We first demonstrate the robustness of the approximation for ordinary functions given by weighted sums of fractional exponents. Additionally, we present more realistic examples utilizing the proposed preconditioning techniques in interface coupling between Darcy and Stokes equations.},

  abstract = {Traveling waves in woodpile chains are typically nanoptera, which are composed of a central solitary wave and exponentially small oscillations. These oscillations have been studied using exponential asymptotic methods, which typically require an explicit form for the leading-order behavior. For many nonlinear systems, such as granular woodpile chains, it is not possible to calculate the leading-order solution explicitly. We show that accurate asymptotic approximations can be obtained using numerical approximation in place of the exact leading-order behavior. We calculate the oscillation behavior for Toda woodpile chains, and compare the results to exponential asymptotics based on previous methods from the literature: long-wave approximation and tanh-fitting. We then use numerical analytic continuation methods based on Pad\'e approximants and the adaptive Antoulas\textendash Anderson (AAA) method. These methods are shown to produce accurate predictions of the amplitude of the oscillations and the mass ratios for which the oscillations vanish. Exponential asymptotics using an AAA approximation for the leading-order behavior is then applied to study granular woodpile chains, including chains with Hertzian interactions\textemdash this method is able to calculate behavior that could not be accurately approximated in previous studies.},

  abstract = {We introduce a new method for Estimation of Signal Parameters based on Iterative Rational Approximation (ESPIRA) for sparse exponential sums. Our algorithm uses the AAA algorithm for rational approximation of the discrete Fourier transform of the given equidistant signal values. We show that ESPIRA can be interpreted as a matrix pencil method (MPM) applied to Loewner matrices. These Loewner matrices are closely connected with the Hankel matrices that are usually employed for signal recovery. Due to the construction of the Loewner matrices via an adaptive selection of index sets, the MPM is stabilized. ESPIRA achieves similar recovery results for exact data as ESPRIT and the MPM, but with less computational effort. Moreover, ESPIRA strongly outperforms ESPRIT and the MPM for noisy data and for signal approximation by short exponential sums.},

We propose that it is much simpler, and 10\textendash 1000 times faster, to represent the maps by rational functions computed by the AAA algorithm. To justify this claim, first we prove a theorem establishing root-exponential convergence of rational approximations near corners in a conformal map, generalizing a result of D. J. Newman in 1964. This leads to the new algorithm for approximating conformal maps of polygons. Then we turn to smooth domains and prove a sequence of four theorems establishing that in any conformal map of the unit circle onto a region with a long and slender part, there must be a singularity or loss of univalence exponentially close to the boundary, and polynomial approximations cannot be accurate unless of exponentially high degree. This motivates the application of the new algorithm to smooth domains, where it is again found to be highly effective.},

Greatly extending a result of D. J. Newman in 1964 in approximation theory, we first prove that such approximations can achieve root-exponential convergence for a wide range of problems, all the way up to the corner singularities. We then develop a numerical method to compute approximations via linear least-squares fitting on the boundary. Typical problems are solved in {$<$} 1s on a desktop to 8-digit accuracy, with the accuracy guaranteed in the interior by the maximum principle. The computed solution is represented globally by a single formula, which can be evaluated in a few microseconds at each point.},

The errors of the fits of orders 1... n, are evaluated in O(Nn2) operations. If the data can be represented exactly with n poles, the algorithm is guaranteed to stop after n iterations (in exact arithmetic). It is possible to fit p rational-functions, sharing the same set of poles, to p sets of data, in O(pNn2) operations. The stability of the poles and Hermitian symmetry of the fit can be guaranteed.},

Although it is always better to approximate from large numbers of samples if they are available, whether equispaced or not, this method often performs impressively even when the sampling grid is coarse. In most cases it gives more accurate approximations than other methods. We support this claim with a review and discussion of nine classes of existing methods in the light of general properties of approximation theory as well as the ``impossibility theorem'' for equispaced approximation. We make careful use of numerical experiments, which are summarized in a sequence of nine figures. Among our new contributions is the observation, summarized in Fig. ~7, that methods such as polynomial least-squares and Fourier extension may be either exponentially accurate and exponentially unstable, or less accurate and stable, depending on implementation.},
