This Julia package adaptively computes rational approximations (i.e., ratios of polynomials) for functions on intervals and other domains in the complex plane.

The [documentation](https://complexvariables.github.io/RationalFunctionApproximation.jl/stable/) includes a walkthrough showing off the main capabilities of the package.

* The [Polynomials](https://juliamath.github.io/Polynomials.jl/stable/) package provides rational functions, but not in a way related to function approximation.
* The [BaryRational](https://juliahub.com/ui/Packages/General/BaryRational) package implements the original (fully discrete) version of the AAA algorithm, as well as Floaterâ€“Hormann rational interpolation.
* The [ApproxFun](https://juliaapproximation.github.io/ApproxFun.jl/stable) package provides 1D and multidimensional function approximation using Chebyshev polynomials and Fourier series. It also has extensive functionality for manipulating the approximations and for solving differential equations.
* There is an [ApproxFunRational](https://github.com/tomtrogdon/ApproxFunRational.jl) package, but it is undocumented.
